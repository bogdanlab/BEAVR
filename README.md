# BEAVR

To run BEAVR with simulated test data, just change the path of the main script to your directory:


Edit `/scripts/run_beavr.sh` and change `MASTER_PATH` to the full path to the directory you just cloned:

```
#!/usr/bin/env sh

MASTER_PATH=/u/home/r/ruthjohn/BEAVR
...
```

Then run!

```
./run_beavr.sh
```
